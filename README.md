📌 What’s This App About?

Weddings involve a lot of moving parts—guest lists, RSVPs, budgets, and more. Our goal is to create an easy-to-use platform that helps couples keep everything in one place, reducing stress and making the planning process smooth and enjoyable.

We’re still working on it, but here’s what we’re planning to include:
✨ Planned Features (Coming Soon 🚀)

💡 Guest List Management – Add, remove, and update guest details effortlessly.
💌 Invitation Tracking – Send invitations and monitor RSVPs in one place.
💰 Budget Planning – Keep an eye on wedding expenses and compare estimates.
📆 Task Management – Organize wedding-related tasks and set deadlines.


    Note: These features aren’t live yet—we’re actively working on them! If you have ideas or feedback, we’d love to hear from you.
